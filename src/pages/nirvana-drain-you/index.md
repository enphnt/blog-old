Even though it might not be as well-known (if that can be said of Nirvana tracks), the track from Nirvana's iconic album Nevermind is still one of my all time favorites. Even Kurt Cobain himself considered this his favorite track for a time: "I love the lyrics, and I never get tired of playing it," Kurt Cobain said. "Maybe if it was as big as 'Teen Spirit', I wouldn’t like it as much." [ <a target="_blank" href=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031083301/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/51942/228308>Rolling Stone interview</a>]

To play it well, this song requires rhythm independence between singing and strumming riffs more than the average Nirvana tune. Still, its good low-hanging fruit for me to build confidence and encourage focused playing to get it right. The melody has a catchy hook that is more complex and lengthy in verses so mastering the delivery will help you become a better singer too.

## Step 1: Learn the Chords & Strumming Patterns for the Song
On the album, Nevermind, this song is recorded using D standard tuning. I’ll be using the album recording as the reference here but it is worth noting that in live performances, Nirvana would often play this in whatever tuning was already present. Because many songs use E♭ standard tuning, its often heard performed that way.

Learning the chords themselves is for Nirvana's Drain You is rather simple. The chords are straightforward and all fit into the key of B major:

### Breaking down the song into it's components
This song consists of a simple structure: 

[Verse 1] > [<strong>Chorus</strong>] > [Verse 2] > [<strong>Chorus</strong>] > [Break] > [Instrumental] > [Verse 1] > [<strong>Chorus</strong>]

At its core, the song follows a common song structure that's pretty typical from Nirvana. Let's take a look at each of the sections individually.

#### Verse
The verse incorporates a rhythmic strumming pattern that actually seems to play off of the same pattern heard in the intro to "Aneurysm" from the Incesticide album, to my ear, at least. I've mapped out how it works in terms of down/upstrokes here: 

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="images/nirvana-drain-you-verse-strumming-pattern.png" alt="nirvana-drain-you-verse-strumming-pattern" width="300px">
</div>

To match the style, note that there is a bit of emphasis on the & of 3. On top of this, the & of 4 is usually a sort of gap between chords and the open standard D strings can be heard briefly. If you're playing this slow, it will not sound very musical so in those instances, you can begin the f#5 and A5 chords a half-beat early to reign in the chaos a bit. 

Additionally, you can omit the 3rd downbeat chord and replace it with a downstroke across muted string. 

From a diatonic perspective, assuming we are in the key of A major, the verse chord pattern looks like this (I-iii-vi-ii):

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="images/nirvana-drain-you-verse.png" alt="I-iii-vi-ii" width="350px">
</div>

To my knowledge, the I-iii-vi-ii chord progression is somewhat unique and not a typical pop song progression but it still has some nice harmonic pull to it. I can think of a couple of other songs I know that use a similar progression:

"The New" by Interpol uses I-iii-vi-ii throughout the whole song but its in the key of C major.

</div>

Bob Dylan's "Lay, Lady, Lay", also in the key of A major, uses I-iii-bVII-ii which is definitely different on the third chord but to my ears, its doing something similar so I thought I'd note it. 
<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

#### Chorus
Tho chorus is basically another four chord loop but with an introduction chords as well as a cadence at the end which uses a non-diatonic chord.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="images/nirvana-drain-you-chorus.png" alt="nirvana-drain-you-chorus" width="350px">
</div>

That use of the flat seventh is not that strange in rock music. It seems to fit right in place and I confess I did not notice it's specialness when listening all these years. To me, the use of flat seventh pushes the overall minor/mixolydian vibe of the song. To my ear, it doesn't come off as bluesy so much but flat sevenths can have that affect so for some it may. 

#### Break
A one chord build is performed for the break in this song. There are basic 'hits' performed on the downbeats and some palm muting while strumming downstrokes. You can play the noisier harmonies by playing the f# chord shape with only the top 3 strings of the guitar (a power chord) and then leavign the bottom strings open so they ring and include the flat 6 (D) note which gives it a forboding sound.

This chaos chord could be described as . Note that it uses altered extensions b9, #9 and b13. These are causing strong dissonance alongside the major 7th (maj7). Dissonance Warning!

</div>

### Practicing the sections
I recommend getting a copy of the song into your DAW. I usually use Logic's Varispeed feature to quick adjust to a tempo slower/faster so I can learn the song. Once you're able to play it back to front with ease, its time to move onto step 2. 

## Step 2: Master the Lyrics & Melody of Drain You
I recommend listening to song at various speeds and singing along as a first step towards vocal mastery. Kurt Cobain uses a solid vocal range and modifies his vocal timbre for each section so learning this song gives you the opportunity to explore your vocal delivery using techniques like vocal fry and distortion.

The melody for verses is really worth examining because of the more intricate delivery: 

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="images/nirvana-drain-you-verse-melody.png" alt="nirvana-drain-you-verse-melody" width="650px">
</div>

The rhythm alone here is worth spending time on. Notice that the one (downbeat) is omitted at the top of each phrase. In addition, its not a single melody that's repeated but its more like four variations of the same melody which are repeated in the verses.

When I practice this, I practice very very slow at first. Sometimes with a metronome and sometimes alongside the slowed-down version of the recording. I then record myself practicing periodically to inspect my progress. Basically, once I'm confident and comfortable singing from start to finish without looking at the lyrics, its time to move on to putting everything together in step 3. 

## Step 3: Practice Singing While Playing the Guitar
For more assistance when practicing, play and sing along to the track slowed down. This is effective when learning but don't forget to practice without it.

        type="audio/mp3"
        src="audio/nirvana - drain you (slowed).mp3">
    </audio>
</figure>

As mentioned, I recommend practicing slowly and deliberately ideally with a metronome.
