Love them or hate them, the Google gang is now a fact of modern life. Whether you need to know what time it is in Antarctica or you're searching for how to overcome some error encountered for the first time, Google is an powerful tool to leverage.

<div class="note">
  <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> In its infancy, Google search was originally called BackRub. This is thought to be an ode to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink">backlink</a> retrieval concept of the system. So next time you search, enjoy the free massage.

### But are you doing it right?

When it comes to finding the more obscure, sometimes the search results can be like a haystack with no needle in sight. To make life easier, the following tips should help you home in on exactly what you're looking for.

#### 1. Exact Match with "Double Quotes"
Use quotation marks to search for something exactly.

Search `"Frank Foster"` to get results which contain both the first and last name of this amazing jazz saxophonist.

This can be extended to other terms to. In this case, it appears a country western artist shares the same name. So to find the sax legend, ensure that all search results also contain the term 'jazz':

- ```"Frank Foster" "jazz"```

#### 2. Subtract terms with -minus operator
Exclude terms by putting a minus (or dash, `-`) in front.

If you wanted to find out who wrote "Breakfast of Champions" (a great read btw), you will get lots of cereal related results, particularly the awful bland flakes called Wheaties.

To remove the flakes, try:

- ```breakfast of champions -wheaties```

#### 3. File extension filtering with 'filetype:'
Get results that are a specified filetype.

If you're on the hunt for a specific PDF file you know exists, you could do something like: `president tax returns filetype:pdf`.

Or perhaps you're after an animated image:

- ```side eye monkey filetype:gif```

#### 4. Results only from this 'site:'
Use this to get results only from a specified website.

Quick example:

- ```us audio interface site:drummersdream.com.au```

#### 5. This OR that with the | operator
For situations where you want to search several things simultaneously.

For example, what if you have 2 favorite coffees and you want to look at results for both:

- ```Vizcaya Guatemala coffee beans | Deri Kocha Ethiopia coffee beans```

#### 6. Search a range of..numbers or price range
Put `..` to search for a range of numbers. This can be combined with `$` to search a price range.

Looking for a new metronome thats within your budget? Try:

- ```metronome $25..$55```

#### 7. Filter results by 'imagesize:widthxheight'
Following your search term/s, add the text `imagesize:widthxheight`. Dimensions can be specified in pixels.

For example, if you want your Nick Cage imgs for the desktop try something like:

- ```nick cage imagesize:1920x1080```
