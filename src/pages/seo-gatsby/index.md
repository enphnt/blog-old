title: "Setting up SEO for a Gatsby blog"
---

Today, I'll be following along the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/adding-common-features/adding-seo-component/#seo-with-gatsby">Gatsby SEO guide</a>. I'll be following these steps roughly:

1. Gauging my current situation
1. Verifying my blog meets prerequisites
1. Adding siteMetadata
1. Creating a useSiteMetadata hook
1. Creating and using an SEO component
1. SEO Component Usage in pages

After these steps, I'll do some testing to see if my SEO has improved using google.


### Verifying my blog meets prerequisites
Unfortunately, this blog is yet to be indexed. Instead of waiting i'll use the google search console to verify the site.

To use search console, I've got to add a meta tag to the site for verification purposes.

After deploying the blog which now contains the verification tag, I was successfully able to to verify ownership. Now, google will spend some time crawling the site here at /blog and indexing all the things.

I'll check the results when I look at this again in the next few days.
