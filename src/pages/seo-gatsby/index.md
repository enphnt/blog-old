Today, I'll be following along the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/adding-common-features/adding-seo-component/#seo-with-gatsby">Gatsby SEO guide</a>. I'll be following these steps roughly:

1. Verifying my blog meets prerequisites
1. Adding siteMetadata
1. Creating a useSiteMetadata hook
1. Creating and using an SEO component
1. SEO Component Usage in pages

After these steps, I'll do some testing to see if my SEO has improved using google.
